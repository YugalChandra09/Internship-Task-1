# Elevate Labs AI/ML Internship - Task 1: Data Preprocessing

## 📝 Objective

[cite_start]This repository contains the solution for Task 1 of the AI & ML Internship program at Elevate Labs[cite: 2]. [cite_start]The primary objective of this task is to demonstrate the ability to clean, preprocess, and prepare raw data to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms[cite: 4]. [cite_start]The project utilizes the well-known Titanic dataset for this purpose[cite: 12].

## 🛠️ Steps Performed

The data cleaning and preprocessing workflow involved the following key steps:

* [cite_start]**Data Loading and Initial Exploration**: The dataset was loaded using the Pandas library, followed by an initial analysis to understand its structure, data types, and identify columns with missing values[cite: 7].

* [cite_start]**Handling Missing Values**: Missing data was addressed using different strategies based on the nature of the column[cite: 8]:
    * The `Age` column's null values were imputed with the median.
    * The `Embarked` column's null values were filled with the mode.
    * The `Cabin` column was dropped entirely due to a high number of missing entries.

* [cite_start]**Categorical Feature Encoding**: Categorical columns (`Sex` and `Embarked`) were converted into a numerical format using one-hot encoding, making them compatible with ML models[cite: 9].

* [cite_start]**Numerical Feature Scaling**: Numerical features (`Age` and `Fare`) were standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure they are on a similar scale, which is crucial for the performance of many models[cite: 10].

* [cite_start]**Outlier Detection and Removal**: Outliers in the `Fare` column were visualized using a boxplot and subsequently removed using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to prevent them from skewing the model's performance[cite: 11].

## 💻 Tools and Libraries Used

* [cite_start]Python [cite: 5]
* [cite_start]Pandas [cite: 5]
* [cite_start]NumPy [cite: 5]
* [cite_start]Matplotlib & Seaborn [cite: 5]
* Scikit-learn
